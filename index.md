# What About Me!?

My name is Parmida (Parm for short)! I am an AI applied research scientist. I did my bachelore in Iran in Electrical Engineering (Don't ask me why? even me, might not have the answer to that question!). However, I was not completely satisfied with the field (you don't say !). Something was missing. I tried taking many courses from the math department, thinking that I am missing some math in my life. It did feel a bit better but not quite. I loved the world of math but not quite the world of mathemations. I needed some sort of attachment to the real world. That's when I had the first interesting course in my primary field of study, Signal Processing. For the first time in three years, I connected with a class and I started to like the subjects and do all the assignments on myown. I liked that you get to understand the fundation of concepts mathematically and then you could use MATLAB to visualize them. In the following semesters, I took many extra curriculumn courses such as DSP (Digital Signal Processing) and Image Processing and hence finishing my bachelore in five years but having a better vision of what I want to do in my life. 

I guess, you see where this is going! I realized that I need to pursue my masters in Computer Science and specifically in Machine Learning and Image processing. I had high hopes for my masters program and generally for my academic life but there was different plan ahead of me. Coming to Canada and doing my masters in Concordia, I quickly realized the academic approach is not really for me. For one, it takes too long and it is too slow. Eventhough my masters program did not include an internship, I took one and I realized I can learn a lot more and faster in industry, therefore, once again I delayed a 2 year master and finished in 3 years but with an understanding that I need to join the industry. 

I started working at ElementAI as an applied research scientist in 2017. Fall in love with AI and learnt a bunch in the following years. Found the most amazing colleagues and friends and built the first well maintained Bayesian ActiveLearning Library in 2018. 

# What do I care about?
How learning happens and how it can be validated. In the context of AI, I am interested in the process of learning a down stream task and validate the quality of learning by uncertainty estimation and bias detection and so on. 

# Wanna have a chat?
Threw me a line in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parmida-atighechian/) and tell me what you are interested in and what would you like to talk about. I am in love with coffee and AI chats!
No AI? no problem, I have quite a few other interests too:
* BoardGame Design and strategy (with my husband)
* History of Earth and Evolution
* Pyschology and human behaviour
